A todo list application built with the [Realm Flutter SDK](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/flutter/).

support Flutter for Web or Linux. Due to a minor issue that should be resolved
soon, it also does not support Android, Windows and MacOS.

## Getting Started

1. Clone and enter the project
1. `flutter pub get`
1. Run device on emulator
