A todo list application built with the [Realm Flutter SDK](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/flutter/)
and [Atlas Device Sync](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/sync/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone and enter the project
2. `flutter pub get`
3. Run the app:
   - on Windows, Linux and macOS `flutter run`
   - on Android emulator or iOS Simulator
     `flutter run` if only one emulator or iOS Simulator is available.
     or get the device id with `flutter devices` and start the app `flutter run -d <device-id>`
     For more information on running a Flutter app see the [Flutter Test Drive documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive).
